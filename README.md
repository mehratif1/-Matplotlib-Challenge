Complete data of 249 mice is provided who were identified with SCC tumors, received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
First the data has been cleaned by identifying and removing the duplicate mouse data , leaving us with the data of 248 mice to analyze.
The summary statistics has been obtained including : mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.
Bar charts are created to show the  total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen throughout the study using (DataFrame.plot) and (pyplot) methods. 
Pie charts have been created to show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study using (DataFrame.plot) and (pyplot) methods. 
Potential outliers across all four treatment regimens were calculated for the total tumor volume .
Further the outliers are shown through plotting a box plot
Line plot and scatter plot is made.
Finally the correlation coefficient is calculated and linear regression model is made.
